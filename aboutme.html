    <p>
      Hi! I'm Cat Elis Galloway, I love traveling, coffee, animals, sleeping, and eating.
    </p>

    <p>
      I visited Prague in September 2024 with my Mam Sarah and my brother Morgan.
      Prague is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever visited, and I felt the need to document my travels in this little travel blog.
      When I visited, it was very hot with temperatures reaching up to 30 degrees. My favorite part of the trip was going to Prague Zoo, there are so many different types of animals there.

      Thanks for visiting my page about prague and I hope you all can enjoy and experince the beautiful
      city and have as much fun as I did! 🐾
