      <img src="pinkhotel.jpeg" alt="Pink hotel in Prague">
      <div class="feature-text">
        <h2>Hotel Opera</h2>
        <p>
          One of the first things I saw as I left my hotel was Hotel Opera.
          I loved the bold pink colour, which inspired the pink used throughout my website.
        </p>
      </div>

      <img src="camertbert.jpeg" alt="Deep fried camembert">
      <div class="feature-text">
        <h2>Deep Fried Camembert</h2>
        <p>
          This is a meal I ate in Prague — deep fried camembert with tartar sauce and salad.
          It was delicious and I can see why it’s considered a comfort food.
        </p>
      </div>

      <img src="map.jpeg" alt="Pin map">
      <div class="feature-text">
        <h2>Pin Map</h2>
        <p>
          This pin map was in the downstairs area of the food place.
          Visitors pin where they are from, and it was overwhelmingly Europe.
          I loved the texture and interactive element.
        </p>
      </div>

      <img src="cruise.jpeg" alt="River cruise at night">
      <div class="feature-text">
        <h2>River Cruise</h2>
        <p>
          My family and I went on a river cruise at dusk.
          It was beautiful seeing the city light up from the water.
        </p>
      </div>

      <img src="burger.jpeg" alt="Burger restaurant">
      <div class="feature-text">
        <h2>Meet Burger</h2>
        <p>
          After the cruise, we wandered the city and found Meet Burger.
          I had wings and a burger, and they even served beer in a three-pint glass!
        </p>
      </div>

      <img src="goosey.jpeg" alt="Goose toy">
      <div class="feature-text">
        <h2>Goosey</h2>
        <p>
          On the last day, I bought one of these goose toys I kept seeing in shops.
          He was huge and difficult to fit in my suitcase — but totally worth it.
        </p>

      <h2>Prague Travel Video</h2>
      <p>
        Here is a video I found of a person walking through Prague. Before I went on my trip,
        I found it helpful to see the city briefly beforehand as it helps with navigation
        and understanding the vibe of the city.
